I'm a student and hobbyist who’s into coding, editing, music, etc. This blog is my space to document the messy, real progress of learning skills, tracking ideas, and working through thoughts that don’t fit anywhere else. You’ll find everything from tech experiments and personal growth to raw notes on guitar, coding, and whatever I’m obsessing over at the moment.
